# KBC_Digital_Interactive_Quiz
This is a fun web-based quiz game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). 
It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game asks questions one by one, gives money for correct answers, and shows a score. 
It also has a “50-50” lifeline to remove two wrong options. 
At the end, users can see their total score and restart the quiz if they want. 
The goal is to help people learn in an enjoyable way.
